# ERC-4908: Gated resources NFT access

Tailored for the needs of the [Ipal platform](https://app.ipal.network/), a web3 friendly [knowledge management platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management_software).
See the [specification](./ERC4908.md) for more details.

## Platform implementation

To prove that 0xAlice has access to 0xBob's specific information, the server must:

1. Authenticate 0xAlice via a message wallet signature request.
2. verify locally that `contentId` belongs to 0xBob.
3. call the `hasAccess(0xBob, contentId, 0xAlice)` contract function
4. verify that the result returned is `true`

## Development

### Getting started

```sh
npm install
```

### Tests & cleaning

```sh
npm run test # Pass env var REPORT_GAS=false to deactivate gas reporting
```

### Deploying the contracts

```sh
cp .env.example .env
vim .env # Add the private key you want to use to deploy the contracts
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Example.ts --network testnet --reset
```

### Verifying the contracts

```sh
npx hardhat verify --network testnet <CONTRACT ADDRESS> <CONSTRUCTOR_PARAMETERS>
```

Example:
```sh
npx hardhat verify --network testnet 0xCE92bb8605a96c17C5f2eb1fa8dfe211EAEE7101
```
